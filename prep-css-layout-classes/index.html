      <h4>The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has
         been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their
         search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit
         named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the Ring and steps into
         legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the
         Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where
         it was forged.

      <h4>The sequel to the Golden Globe-nominated and AFI Award-winning 'The Lord
       of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,' 'The Two Towers' follows the
       continuing quest of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and the Fellowship to destroy the
       One Ring. Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin) discover they are being followed by
       the mysterious Gollum. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the Elf archer
       Legolas and Gimli the Dwarf encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom, whose

      <h4>The culmination of nearly 10 years' work and conclusion to Peter
        Jackson's epic trilogy based on the timeless J.R.R. Tolkien classic,
        'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' presents the final
        confrontation between the forces of good and evil fighting for control
        of the future of Middle-earth. Hobbits Frodo and Sam reach Mordor in
        their quest to destroy the `one ring', while Aragorn leads the forces
        of good against Sauron's evil army at the stone city of Minas Tirith.
